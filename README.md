# RotMG-Potion-Calculator
This is a potion calculator for the game Realm of the Mad God. In the game, you can purchase potions to level up the stats of your character,
thereby giving them better attacks, defense, health points, etc. However, the potions only max out your stats to the highest it can be for a given level,
which means that a character can grind for improvements or they can buy the skill upgrades in equivalent potions.

We decided that we would make a calculator that would allow a user to input the various current stats of a character into a GUI,
then it would calculate how much a user would have to spend on potions in order to increase the stats to the highest possible 
amount for the given level.

We used Javafx and Scenebuilder in this project to design the GUI.
